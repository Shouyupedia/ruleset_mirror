# ruleset mirror

## Binary rule sets

GitHub Actions compiles supported sources alongside the original files:

- `Clash/domainset/*.txt` becomes domain-behavior `*.mrs`.
- CIDR-only `Clash/ip/*.txt` becomes ipcidr-behavior `*.mrs`.
- `sing-box/{domainset,non_ip,ip}/*.json` becomes `*.srs`.

Mihomo MRS does not support classical rule sets. `Clash/non_ip` and IP files
containing unsupported rules such as `IP-ASN` remain available in source form
and are not converted into incomplete binaries.
